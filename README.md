## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms form the foundation of computer science. This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of common DSA topics. Whether you are preparing for coding interviews or looking to improve your problem-solving skills, this repository will be a valuable resource.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dsa-repo.git
    cd dsa-repo
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Directory Structure


## Algorithms

### Sorting
- **Bubble Sort**: A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- **Quick Sort**: An efficient sorting algorithm using divide and conquer.
- **Merge Sort**: A stable sorting algorithm using divide and conquer.

### Searching
- **Binary Search**: A logarithmic time search algorithm for sorted arrays.
- **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm with linear time complexity.

## Data Structures

- **Linked List**: A linear collection of data elements, where the linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory.
- **Stack**: A collection of elements with LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
- **Queue**: A collection of elements with FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
